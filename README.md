# LONG JUMP

## Introduction
The object of Long Jump is to see who can jump the farthest.  You must run as fast as possible as far as possible without crossing the line before jumping.  Faster speeds will give longer jumps.  This is a recreation of a game that I made in the 80s for my TRS-80 Pocket Computer PC-3.  The PC-4 only had a single line display so the Model 100 allowed me to add some modest additional graphics, even with only 10 lines of code.  The original PC-3 game was inspired by "Summer Games" for the Commodore 64.

## Gameplay
Run by pressing the F and J keys as fast as possible.  The time begins as soon as you press "f" or "j" the first time.  Get as close as possible to the line before jumping by pressing the spacebar.  Be sure caps-lock is not on.  Only lower case letters will count toward your speed.
